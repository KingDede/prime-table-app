> A simple javascript app to generate a multiplication table of (N) prime numbers.

## Code Review
The prime number generation works and can generate the first 1 million prime numbers in ~5 sec. This could be improved using a sieve technique. It has been a while since I've used javascript so I feel I'm not as confident as some other programming languages although I remembered things as I went along. As a student the whole idea of unit tests and the test driven approach is somewhat new to me but I am glad to have learnt more about them and hope to try putting them into practice more often.
